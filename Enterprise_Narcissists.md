# Enterprise Narcissists

A commenter noted that maybe EAs should admit that there are many ways to achieve their goals, and they shouldn't be so narcissistic about EA. Another commenter noted that often, especially if you have people who really know the enterprise, you can do EA totally informally with no formal EA at all.

So why (formal) EA?

I would say as follows:

1. It's like the SDLC but on a broader scale. True, every app dev team in your org could develop software their own way, using their own methods, their own doc templates (or none at all). And that might work out OK for each team. It may be "quick and dirty" and "cheap and cheerful". But from an enterprise perspective, it's a mess, and hard to manage. So we introduce SDLCs. Likewise, **EA is basically an ADLC for the Enterprise**. SDLC focused on Solution Architecture, the ADLC focuses on Enterprise Architecture.

2. The example above focused on having consistent processes from a management perspective. But EA is much more than just having consistent processes. **EA ensures that everything is aligned as it should be**. EA takes an enterprise view, rather than just seeing a slice of the enterprise. EA looks across all domains. True, other disciplines can also take an enterprise view, but then **either they are basically doing EA under another name, or they are not doing it as well as EA would.**

3. Following on from 2, without explicit EA, every project, business unit, geography etc. is naturally incented to do what's best for them, which is often not what's best for the enterprise. **Only an explicit EA practice is incented to push for what's best for the enterprise.**

So in summary, the value of having a formal EA Practice (or Capability etc.) as opposed to just letting EA happen informally, is:

1. A formal approach to EA creates consistency, more usable data, and is easier to manage.

2. An EA practice will have a broader view than an individual team and hence can better "connect the dots".

3. Individual teams are incented to do what's best for them. An EA Practice would be incented to do what's best for the Enterprise
