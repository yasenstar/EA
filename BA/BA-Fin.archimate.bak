        <content>All of these 3 groups have same sub business units, suggest to prevent these duplications. We can distribute these five sub business units to different shared organization based on the company's value stream and capability, then treat the 3 group as the selling model of the different product, hence we make the matrix organization charts. The selling model can also form the concept of Center of Excellence teams</content>
