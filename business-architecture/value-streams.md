# Value Streams

## Definition of Value Stream

In SAFe, a **Value Stream** is defined as a "long-lived series of steps that an enterprise uses to provide a continuous flow of value to a customer."

From wikipedia, **Value Stream** are artifacts within business architecture that allow a business to specify the value proposition derived by an external \(e.g., customer\) or internal stakeholder from an organization. 

In BIZBOK v10.0, the **Value Stream** is defined as "a visual depiction of how an organization achieves value for a given stakeholder or stakeholders within the context of a given set of business activities."

* A **Value Stream** may depict how a customer achieves value or satisfaction when licensing or procuring a product or service.
* A second **Value Stream** may depict how that same stakeholder achieves value when making and receiving payment for a claim.

## More Definitions Around "Value"

**Value** can be defined as "the benefit that is derived by an organization's stakeholder while interacting with that organization".

**Value Proposition** is defined as "an innovation, service, or feature intended to make a company, product, or service attractive to customers or related stakeholders."

**Value Item** is defined as "the judgment of worth, made by an individual or organization, attached to something tangible or intangible and attained in the course of a particular interaction with one or more other parties."

**Value Items** represent a judgment of worth within the context of an interaction defined by a value stream.

## Value Streams and Enabling Business Capabilities

Finding the enabling capabilities of a value stream should be **completed** for all customer-driven value streams of an organization.
