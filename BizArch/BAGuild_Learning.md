### 1. Customer Service Definition & Piroritization

#### Defining Customer Services

##### A direct one-on-one interaction between a consumer and company representative, commonly engaged when a consumer is buying a product or service

##### Misconception #1: A customer service is only delivered by a company representative

###### With hyper-automation and AI, customer services are increasingly being delivered by machines, not people

###### Organizations must architect and design software solutions to be delivered by people, but evolve towards automation while providing the option of human intervention (干涉)

##### Misconception #2: Customer services are primarily realized during product acquisition

###### Customer services are more often than not experienced post-acquisition

###### Consider use of a credit card, theater ticket, insurance policy, car rental, airline ticket, vehicle, software package shipment and other examples where customer services are primarily delivered post-purchase

##### A better definition of customer service: "The support you offer your customers - both before and after they buy and use your products or services." (SalesForce.com

#### Customer Service: A Key Element of Product

##### Product is defined as:

###### "The overall experience provided by the combination of goods and services to satisfy the customer's needs".

Source: Greg Geracie and Stephen Eppinger,The Guide to the Product Management and Marketing Body of Knowledge (ProdBOK)  (Association of International Product Marketing and Management, 2013)

 
Products by definition include goodsand services, because that is what the customer experiences before, during and after acquiring a product.

 
In industry sections where service is an essential element of a product or the entirety of a product, customer service determines if an organizationthrives, survives or ultimately fails (蓬勃发展、生存或最终失败)

 
To be clear: Customer always refers to the end or external customer, client, consumer, constituent, patient or other beneficiary of an organization's goods and services - andnever to an internal stakeholders


#### The state of customer service: Perception vs. Reality

##### Customer are not happy:

1 in 3 customers hasscreamed or sworn  (尖叫或发誓) at a customer service agent


###### 73% of consumers reported having experienced a customer service agent being rude to them and 44% have had an agent become agitated (激动).

###### 3 in 5 people have hung up on an agent at least once out of frustration

###### 39% of consumers have less patience now than they did prior to the pandemic

###### 30% of customers will wait a maximum of 2 minutes for an agent on chat

###### 43% of consumers being long hold times are the most frustrating aspect of customer service

###### 25% have had to contact a company 3 or more times to resolve a single issue

###### 53% of consumers have publicly shamed a company for providing poor customer service

###### 62% of consumers have been ghosted by company's customer service call-back options

##### Business leaders seem unaware of the situation:

###### There is 57% gap between how business leaders perceive that customers trust their organization vs. the reality of only 27% of customers actually trusting their organization

#### Justifying across the Board Investment in Customer Services

##### Excellent customer service delivers financial benefits

###### Customer retention is cheaper than customer acquisition

###### Customer will pay more to companies with better customer service

###### Customer service grows customer lifetime value

###### Customer service can lead to more revenue

##### With the state of customer service poor and benefits of excellent service clear, one would assume that organizations would be laser focused on maximizing quality customer service

##### Why then do organizations appear more focused on delivering internally targeted services vs. investing in delivering excellent service to the actual customer?
 (see:3. Cross Product Line Investment Scaling)
### 2. Intersection of Customer Service Delivery & Business Architecture

#### Business Architecture formalizes Customer Service Delivery

##### Customer services are delivered through value streams, such as Execute Financial Transaction, Obtain Funding, Send Shipment, Service Vehicle, Settle Claim, Trade Financial Instrument and Take a Trip

##### Consier a Settle Claim Value Stream

###### Claims may be filed by the insured, a beneficiary of the insured, an individual whose property was damaged by the insured, or a provider seeking reimbursement for services, all using the same value stream

###### The customer in each case is "entitled" to being able to submit a claim request, having the claim vetted or validated, and being made whole in one way or another

###### These "entitlements" are associated with various insurance products with differences for various product types

###### Investing in the universe of entitlements for a given product or products ensures that the value delivered to teh customer through a given value stream is maximized and delivery streamlined

#### Value Streams mapping with Capabilities

#### In Business Architecture terms, Customer Service is equivalent to Product Entitlement
 
Product Entitlement is defined as a specified aspect of a product that represents an inherentcommitment  made by an organization to a customer that is realized as an immediate, on demand, or continue obligation of the organization to the customer that acquired that product


##### The ability or inability to keep or meet these commitments determines if an organization:

###### Provides high quality services to its customers as promised, or ends up forfeiting the customer's trust

###### Achieves the aforementioned (前述) benefits associated with excellent customer service that in turn lead to tangible bottom line results

##### Bottom Line: in order to maintain existing and attract new customers, gain related financial benefits, demand more for their products and secure customers for life, organizations should prioritize investing in product entitlements.

#### Sample Product Entitlements

##### Product entitlements are specified in the language of the customer, where a customer would concur (同意) that they are entitled to certain services as a consumer, owner or licensee of a product

##### Product entitlements can span multiple products, which opens opportunities to consolidate delivery fo that entitlement

##### Sample product entitlements are shown for 4 different products, framed in passive vs. active terms

###### 1) Vehicle Navigation Product

* Destination identification

* Multiple route map plotting

* Points of interest highlighting enroute

* Cartography visualization

* Read-out-loud communications

* Route status notification

* Time to destination charting

###### 2) Freezer with Repair Warranty

* Engage in real time appliance monitoring

* Provide automated issue diagnosis

* Communicate with status to customer

* Notify customer of issue(s)

* Order parts

* Schedule onsite repair

###### 3) Credit Card Offering

* Real time balance verification

* Real time fraud detection

* Card cancellation

* Card suspension

* Multichannel communication

###### 4) Insurance Auto Policy

* Claim approval

* Claim filing

* Claim payout

* Damage estimate

* Fraud investigation

* Loaner vehicle

* Police report access

* Vehicle repair

* Vehicle repair shop identification

* Vehicle protection best practices notification

#### Product Entitlement Descriptions

##### Product Entitlements are described in language that is readily interpreted by business professionals.

##### Each product entitlement has a buisness friendly, formal description

##### Organizations should try to standardize terms across related product lines, like insurance lines

##### Sample descriptions

###### Claim Approval: Allows for a submitted to be reviewed, validated, adjudicated, and approved for settlement.

###### Claim Filing: Allows claimants to submit a claim to the company through anyone of multiple channels and have it routed to the right place

###### Claim Payout: Provides for the determination of the settlement amount and distribution to the appropriate parties.

###### Damage Estimate: Ensures that one or more determinations of cost associated with the incident are provided to the claimant and other relevant parties

###### Fraud Investigation: Provides for a fraud investigation as required to ensure that a claim filing was legitimate.

###### Loaner Vehicle: Facilitates access to a vehicle while the claimant and other parties await repair or replacement

###### Police Report Access: Allow the claimant and related parties to gain access to the incident report from the proper authorities.

###### Vehicle Repair: Verifies that all issues associated with the incident are addressed as allowed for by the customer's agreement

###### Vehicle Repair Shop Identification: Ensures that the claimant is routed to the appropriate repair shop for an estimate and repairs

###### Vehicle Protection Best Practices Notification: Delivers periodic information to the customer

#### Product Entitlements are Enabled by Capabilities

##### Product Entitlement / Capability cross-mapping targets investments into customer services

###### Capability enablement of products is derived from the capabilities required to deliver those entitlements

###### Cross-mapping product entitlements to enabling capabilities highlights investment targets for improving customer services

###### Product entitlement wording is framed based on the phrase, "As a customer I am entitled to..."

##### Product entitlement mapping template below cross-maps entitlements to the capabilities that enable them

### 3. Cross Product Line Investment Scaling
 
Capability Investment in Value Streamsmirror Capability Investment in Product Entitlements


##### Product Entitlements are typically delivered through multiple value streams

##### Auto Insurance product entitlements link back to 3 value streams with a 4th potential targeted after the fact

##### In the example, most entitlements are delivered thorugh Settle Claim value stream with the exceptions of

###### Fraud investigation into a claim, which may be triggered during or post-settlement as a standalone value stream called Resolve Fraud

###### Standalone requests for information to various parties, including scheduled notifications to customers, are sent via the Disseminate Information value stream

###### Acquire Coverage value stream may be triggered internally to adjust the insured customer's rates

#### Scaling Product Planning & Customer Service Design

##### Organizations can scale product, product entitlement / customer service and value stream investments by identifying shared enabling capabilities across business units and product lines

##### Targeting capabilities that optimize customer service delivery maximizes cross-portfolio investments

### 4. Shifting to a Customer Service Focused Enterprise

#### Positioning an Organization to Establish Customer Service-Driven, Capability Investment Model

##### Refocus the culture away from internal business service exchanges, where the end customer is deprioritized

##### Internal service exchange can be destabilized by even simple reorganizations involving merged, new or discontinued business untis

###### Internal service level commitments, which may be useful in some scenarios, deliver a false sense of security and undermine efforts to work collectively to maximize end customer value

###### Internal service exchange concept reinforces business unit silos, undermining the investment scalability benefits across business units and product lines
 (see:Scaling Product Planning & Customer Service Design)
###### Most critically, internal service investments turn critical investment dollars away from delivering value to the end customer

#### Establishing Business Architecture Baseline to Facilitate Cross-Ecosystem Customer Service Investments

##### Business Architecture mappings

###### Capabilities, information concepts, organization and value stream

###### Product map with product lines,products and product entitlements

##### Business Architecture cross-mappings

###### Capabilities-to-ValueStreams

###### Capabilties-to-BusinessUnits to highlight capability instances

###### Capability instances-to-product entitlements

###### Product lines/business units

##### A means of capturing, representing and tracking this information in formal knowledgebase

#### Establishing a Business Architecture-Driven, IT Architecture Transformation Baseline

##### Business Architecture to IT Architecture mappings form the basis for driving IT transformation

##### Capabilities, capability instances and capability behaviors inform software service design

###### Capabilities are non-redundant, object-based and outcome specific

###### Capabilities decompose to multiple levels of granularity to inform software service design at multiple levels

##### Information concepts required and modified by capabilities inform data architecture

###### Information concepts are well defined, non-redundant and object based perspectives

###### Using information concepts as data modeling inputs ensures that capability-based software services have the data they require

### 5. In Summary

#### Poor customer service leads to lost trust and lost customers

#### Excellent customer service leads to improved financial results and long-term customer loyalty

#### Business architecture provides a means of improving customer service by targeting product entitlements

#### Product entitlement improvements are realized through capability investments that enable those entitlements, which parallel capability investments in value streams

#### Organizations can shift to a customer service delivery improvement culture by:

##### Deemphasizing internal service mapping in favor of investing in improving services to end customers

##### Formalizing a business architecture that includes a viable baseline coupled with product mapping

##### Formally driving IT investments from through a business architecture lens

#### Finally, scaling product line investments may require transforming budget and compensation models to enable cross-ecosystem investments
