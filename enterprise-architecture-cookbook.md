# Enterprise Architecture Cookbook

'Architecture', in a broad sense, is the synergy of ART and SCIENCE in designing complex structures, such that functionality and complexity are controlled. The notion of architecture is used in a wide range of domains, from town planning to building and construction, and from computer hardware to information systems, each being characterized by the types of 'structures' or 'systems' being designed.

To begin with, architecture, and hence the architect, is concerned with understanding and defining the relationship between the users of the system and the system being designed itself. Based on a thorough understanding of its relationship, the architect defines and refines the essence of the system, i.e., its structure, behavior, and other properties.

This representation of the system's ESSENCE, also called the 'architecture' of the system, forms the basis for analysis, optimization, and validation and is the starting point for the further design, implementation, and construction of that system. The resulting artifacts, be they buildings or information systems, naturally have to conform to the original design. The definition of the architecture is the input for verifying this.

During this process, the architect needs to communicate with all stakeholders of the system, ranging from clients and users to those who build and maintain the resulting system. The architect needs to balance all their needs and constraints to arrive at a feasible and acceptable design.

Comparing to build a new house, or rebuild one existing one, building or rebuilding an organization is a much more complex and challenging task.

* First of all, the steps one has to take in order to \(re\)build an organization are not standardized.
  * One could start by first \(re\)designing business processes, followed by the application \(re\)design.
  * Or one could first design generic application services, followed by designing business processes on top of these.
* Secondly, building an organization is a complex and challenging task because of the multifarious dependencies within an organization.

Many \(often unknown\) above dependencies exist between various domains, like strategy, products and services, business processes, organizational structure, applications, information management and technical infrastructure. Besides having a good overview of these different domains, one needs to be aware of their interrelationships. Together, these form the _enterprise architecture_ of the organization.

The _enterprise architecture_ can be defined as the practice that tries to describe and control an organization's structure, processes, applications, systems, and technology in such an integrated way. More specifically, we focus on methods and techniques for making and using integrated descriptions by means of architecture models, visualization of these models for various stakeholders, and analysis of the impact of changes.

An architecture model is not just useful to provide insight into the current or future situation; it can also be used to evaluate the transition from 'as is' to 'to be'.
