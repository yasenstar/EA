# Enterprise Architecture Cookbook

'Architecture', in a broad sense, is the synergy of ART and SCIENCE in designing complex structures, such that functionality and complexity are controlled. The notion of architecture is used in a wide range of domains, from town planning to building and construction, and from computer hardware to information systems, each being characterized by the types of 'structures' or 'systems' being designed.

To begin with, architecture, and hence the architect, is concerned with understanding and defining the relationship between the users of the system and the system being designed itself. Based on a thorough understanding of its relationship, the architect defines and refines the essence of the system, i.e., its structure, behavior, and other properties.

This representation of the system's ESSENCE, also called the 'architecture' of the system, forms the basis for analysis, optimization, and validation and is the starting point for the further design, implementation, and construction of that system. The resulting artifacts, be they buildings or information systems, naturally have to conform to the original design. The definition of the architecture is the input for verifying this.

During this process, the architect needs to communicate with all stakeholders of the system, ranging from clients and users to those who build and maintain the resulting system. The architect needs to balance all their needs and constraints to arrive at a feasible and acceptable design.

Comparing to build a new house, or rebuild one existing one, building or rebuilding an organization is a much more complex and challenging task.

* First of all, the steps one has to take in order to \(re\)build an organization are not standardized.
  * One could start by first \(re\)designing business processes, followed by the application \(re\)design.
  * Or one could first design generic application services, followed by designing business processes on top of these.
* Secondly, building an organization is a complex and challenging task because of the multifarious dependencies within an organization.

Many \(often unknown\) above dependencies exist between various domains, like strategy, products and services, business processes, organizational structure, applications, information management and technical infrastructure. Besides having a good overview of these different domains, one needs to be aware of their interrelationships. Together, these form the _enterprise architecture_ of the organization.

The _enterprise architecture_ can be defined as the practice that tries to describe and control an organization's structure, processes, applications, systems, and technology in such an integrated way. More specifically, we focus on methods and techniques for making and using integrated descriptions by means of architecture models, visualization of these models for various stakeholders, and analysis of the impact of changes.

An architecture model is not just useful to provide insight into the current or future situation; it can also be used to evaluate the transition from 'as is' to 'to be'.

## Introduction of Enterprise Architecture

It is often said that to manage the **complexity** of any large organization or system, you need architecture. To create an overview of the structure of an organization, its business processes, their application support, and the technical infrastructure, you need to express the different **aspects** and **domains**, and their **relations**.

IEEE 1471-2000 / ISO/IEC 42010:2007 \(IEEE Computer Society 2000\) defines architecture as:

> **Architecture** is the fundamental organization of a system embodied in its components, their relationships to each other, and to the environment, and the principle guiding its design and evolution.

This definition accommodates both the blueprint and the general principles. More succinctly, we could define **architecture** as '**structure with a vision**'. An architecture provides an integrated view of the system being designed or studied.

As well as the definition of architecture, following are two other definitions coming from IEEE standard:

> **Stakeholder**: an individual, team, or organization \(or classes thereof\) with interests in, or concerns relative to, a system.

Most stakeholders of a system are probably not interested in its architecture, but only in the impact of this on their concern. However, an architect needs to be aware of these concerns and discuss them with the stakeholders, and thus should be able to explain the architecture to all stakeholders involved, who will often have completely different backgrounds.

> **Enterprise**: an collection of organizations that has a common set of goals and/or a single bottom line.

Architecture at the level of an entire organization is commonly referred to as 'enterprise architecture'. This leads to the definition of:

> **Enterprise Architecture**: a coherent \(相干\) whole of principles, methods and models that are used in the design and realization of an enterprise's organizational structure, business processes, information systems, and infrastructure.

Enterprise Architecture captures the **essentials** of the business, IT and its evolution. The idea is that the essentials are much **more stable** than the specific solutions that are found for the problems currently at hand. Architecture is therefore helpful in **guarding the essentials** of the business, while still **allowing for maximal flexibility and adaptivity**.
