# What is EA Actually?

## MITRE

| Item | Detail |

| Definition | "An Enterprise Architecture translates business vision and strategy into effective enterprise change by creating, communicating and improving the essential requirements, principles, drivers, and models, that describe the enterprise's future state and enable its evolution." |
| Applicability | The EA "establishes the organization-wide roadmap to achieve the mission through optimal performance of its core business functions within an efficient information technology (IT) environment." |
| Review | IT-centric view or bottom-up view from IT to business functionality. It relates to the "Enterprise IT Architecture or EITA". |

| Definition | "Enterprise architecture is a discipline for proactively and holistically leading enterprise responses to disruptive forces by identifying and analyzing the execution of change toward desired business vision and outcomes." |
| Applicability | "EA delivers value by presenting business and IT leaders with signature-ready recommendations for adjusting policies and projects to achieve target business outcomes that capitalize on relevant business disruptions." |
| Review | So, EA is a discipline, not an architecture. Apparently, since EA creates nothing but recommendations, it is not "leading enterprise responses to disruptive forces" enterprise-wide because it is the Corporate Business that leads responses to market and regulation changes. Thus, recommendations can be overcome and igored. The only area where EA can really lead is IT and only in the cases where business involves EA in Programmed and Project planning. |

## MIT CISR

| Definition | MIT does not define EA. Instead, it describes what EA is doing in the enterprise. However, it remains unclear whether these activities are the exclusive prerogative of the EA, as well as whether EA does something else. |
| Applicability | "Enterpriese Architecture is the organizing logic for crucial business processes and its capabilities reflecting the integration and standardization requirements of the firm's operating model." |
