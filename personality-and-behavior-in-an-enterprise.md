# "Personality" and "Behavior" in an Enterprise

Interest learning from MBTI Assessment, they're talking about Personality and Behavior, with follwing characteristics:

Personality

* The habitual ways in which people think, feel, and act on most occations
* All the qualities and characteristics a person exhibits

Behavior

* Actual acts, observable
* The result of a complex mix of factors

When comparing them each other, "Personality" is something from people's inner side, and is coming from born and can be gradually influenced by the environment during growth, but should be stable and not changing frequently; while "Behavior" is the way of people really act based on purpose, so it should be adaptive and based on the circustances.

Looking these pair of concept into one enterprise, especially on business architecture pespective, interestingly I can see following two aspects can be mapped:

| Human | Enterprise |
| :--- | :--- |
| Personality | Capability |
| Behavior | Process |
