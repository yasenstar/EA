# TOGAF vs ArchiMate

TOGAF and ArchiMate are enterprise architecture \(EA\) standars. Enterprise architecture is the proess by which businesses standadize and organize their IT infrastructure to align with business goals.

One reason TOGAF and ArchiMate seem similar is that The Open Group manages and maintain both standards. The Open Group is a global consortium that develops vendor-neutral technology standards and certifications.

EA supports an organization's Digital Transformation. It promotes IT growth and the modernization of IT as a department.

Both TOGAF and ArchiMate follow the basic concepts of EA that the ISO 42010 standard defines. The International Organization of Standardization \(ISO\) is an independent international organization. It develops standards to ensure the quality, safety, and efficiency of products, services, and systems.

ISO 42010 distinguishes between the architecture itself and the documentation of that archtiecture. It recommends what an architecture description should include, but it doesn't specify the form it should take.

ArchiMate an TOGAF are both enterprise architecture standards. They don't fulfill the same purpose, though.

**TOGAF deals with the architecture itself while ArchiMate provides a means of describing it.**

## What is TOGAF 9.2?

TOGAD is an architecture framework. Perhaps more accurately, it is a framework of frameworks that describes elements of EA practice. TOGAF helps businesses align IT goals with overall business goals.

The most detailed content is the Architectural Development Method \(ADM\), which explains how to develop architectures. TOGAF has four architectural domains:

| Domains | Contents |
| :--- | :--- |
| Business Architecture | includes business strategy, governance, and organization. It describes how the adapt existing processes. |
| Application Architecture | provides a method for structuring and using application systems in alignment with business goals. |
| Data Architecture | defines how to structure data storage. |
| Technology Architecture | describes the hardware, software, and infrastructure a business needs to meet its goals. |

## What is ArchiMate 3.1?

ArchiMate is a Modelling Language. It helps enterprise architects to describe, analyze, and visualize the relationships among different architecture domains. ArchiMate provides a simple and uniform structure for describing the contents within domains and the relationships between them.

ArchiMate functions like an architectural drawing in traditional building architecture. Architectural diagrams show aspects of the construction and use of a building. In a similar way, ArchiMate offers a common language for describing the construction and operation of functions like:

* Business Strategy and Capabilities
* Business Processes
* Organizational Structures
* Information Flows
* IT Systems

ArchiMate supports high-level modelling that facuses on the essence of an organization.
