One interesting but relavent article here: [How Elon Musk Learns Faster Than Everyone Else](https://medium.com/@mariastepanova7/how-elon-musk-learns-faster-than-everyone-else-26c5cf4c2ef5), this can be also the disppline that one Enterprise Architect practice:

__Rule#1 -- Make sure you are building a Tree of Knowledge__

Quote from Musk: _"It is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree -- make sure you understand the fundamental principles, i.e. the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang onto."_

If you want to learn anything faster, you need to start with the fundamentals. Understand the core concepts first, before moving into more details.

__Rule#2 -- You can't remember what you can't connect__

In order to increase your chances of success, learn the fundamentals of the chosen fields first. Only then start expanding your knowledge.

Learn across multiple fields and work tirelessly on making connections.
