principles, guidelines, practices and samples for building up enterprise architecture



### UML vs ArchiMate

Thanks Viking.

Pros of Archimate:

- Mechanism for understanding the meta-architecture of a technology environment
- Intended to model the architecture of the whole program (several systems)
- Complementary with TOGAF ADM
- Inter-model semantics
- __Based on UML__. But it is not consistent with UML (e.g. new notations for the same thing)
- Notation more expressive than "plane" UML-diagrams
- Viewpoints support relations between layers

Pros of UML:

- Able to model the viewpoints, provided by ArchiMate, with UML as well
- Would not require an additional notation and a new too respective and an extended license (in case of EA)
