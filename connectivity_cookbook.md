# Why This Book?

This is one of the working experience in my current proctices & projects, that we need to deal with variable challenges among different applications integrations, cross security zone, cross domain, and cross the client / server interfaces.

Looking for one uniform pattern to solve the connectivity (either in application layer or in infrastructure layer) is almost not achievable, but more and more practices lead to clearer view on the patterns which should be summarized and reviewed in the higher full picture manner.

This is team efforts and I'd like to thanks the key contributors, who are Kenneth Stenlund, Sven Langenbach, Rafael Reinas, Mikael Olsson and Scott Toth, also many helps from different functions and teams.

Would like to trigger this book's rewritten here to make it public and also generic on the industry.
